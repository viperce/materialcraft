# Control protocol and MCP

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-11-02 · **Last updated:** 2026-11-03 · **Change:** minor (`material_export` MCP tool) · **Target:** the professional node-based material workflow

Agents drive MaterialCraft three ways, all dispatching the same engine commands:

1. **MCP** (`materialcraft-cli mcp`): headless (an in-process session, files only below
   `--read-root` / `--write-root`, also spelled `--automation-read-root` /
   `--automation-write-root` as in the other crafting apps; `serve` takes them too) or bridged to the running app (`--bridge <port>`).
2. **JSON lines** (`materialcraft-cli serve`): the same methods on stdio, or on `127.0.0.1:<port>`
   behind a token.
3. **The app's control channel** (`materialcraft --control <port>`): one JSON request per line,
   `{"id", "method", "params"}` → `{"id", "ok": true, "result"}` or `{"id", "ok": false, "error"}`.
   The first request must be `{"method":"auth","params":{"token":"…"}}` with the token from
   `MATERIALCRAFT_CONTROL_TOKEN` (16 to 1024 printable ASCII characters) or the file
   `<temp>/materialcraft-control-<port>.token`, a fresh random 256-bit token written after the port
   is bound. On Unix the file is created new with mode 0600 (owner only); if an existing file there
   cannot be replaced, the control server stays off and `MATERIALCRAFT_CONTROL_TOKEN` is the
   alternative. Clients (`materialcraft-cli mcp --bridge`) refuse a token file that is a symlink,
   not a regular file, not owned by them, or accessible to group or others. A connection gets one
   authentication attempt, within 10 s; a wrong token, any other first request or malformed JSON
   closes it. At most 16 connections are served at once. Whoever holds the token has full
   engine-command authority, including host file access.
   Set `MATERIALCRAFT_NO_PREFS=1` for scripted runs so the user's layout is left alone.

## Methods

| Method | Where | What |
|---|---|---|
| `ping` | all | `"pong"` |
| `command.list {filter?}` | all | every command: id, label, menu, shortcut, params doc, enabled |
| `command.run {id, params?}` | all | run one command (programmatic: never opens a dialog) |
| `command.batch {steps}` | headless | run `[{id, params}]` in order, stop at the first error |
| `session.inspect` | all | package, graphs, the open graph's nodes (def, params, bindings, base, ports, cook error/size/mean/ms), wires, frames, comments, pins, exposed inputs, views, history |
| `package.open {path}` / `package.save {path?}` | headless | workspace-scoped package I/O |
| `bitmap.import {path, name?}` | headless | embed an image as a resource |
| `outputs.export {dir, format?, pattern?, depth?, size?, graph?}` | headless | cook at full size and write every output |
| `material.export {path, graph?, size?, values?}` | headless | write a portable `.mcmat` below the write root |
| `render {view?, width?, height?, yaw?, pitch?, scene?, node?, port?, full?, tiling?, hq?, displacement?}` | headless | PNG (base64) of the 3D view or of one node; `hq` is the beauty render (displaced mesh, ray-traced AO, shadowed key light, 3×3 supersampling), `displacement` its depth in scene radii |
| `ui.inspect` | app | UI state, the graph view rectangle, every node's screen rectangle, every port's identifier, display label and screen position, fps, toasts |
| `ui.menu.list` / `ui.menu.invoke {id}` | app | the menu catalog; behave like a click |
| `ui.panel.maximize {panel}` | app | maximize an open, active panel: `Graph`, `Explorer`, `Library`, `View3d`, `View2d`, `Properties`, `Console`, or `History`; restore with `ui.menu.invoke {"id":"ui.unmaximize"}` |
| `ui.set {...}` | app | recursively merge fields into the UI state |
| `ui.input {events}` | app | synthetic input, below |
| `view.screenshot {view?: "3d"\|"2d"}` | app | PNG of the 3D or 2D view |
| `ui.screenshot` | app | PNG of the whole window |
| `ui.resize {width, height}` | app | window size in points |

### Synthetic input (`ui.input`)

Events are applied one frame at a time, so egui sees real presses, drags and releases. Positions are
window points (take them from `ui.inspect`'s `nodes` and `ports`).

```json
{"method": "ui.input", "params": {"events": [
  {"type": "drag", "from": [512, 140], "to": [600, 220], "steps": 12},
  {"type": "click", "pos": [700, 300], "button": "left", "modifiers": ["ctrl"]},
  {"type": "doubleClick", "pos": [640, 180]},
  {"type": "scroll", "pos": [640, 300], "delta": [0, -120]},
  {"type": "key", "key": "Space"},
  {"type": "text", "text": "perlin"},
  {"type": "key", "key": "Enter"}
]}}
```

Types: `move`, `down`, `up`, `click`, `doubleClick`, `drag`, `scroll`, `key` (egui key names:
`A`, `Enter`, `Space`, `Delete`, `F5`, …), `text`. Buttons: `left`, `right`, `middle`.

`ui.inspect.maximizedPanel` reports the temporary maximized panel, or `null`. Maximizing
preserves the saved workspace. Shift+Space toggles maximization under the pointer; text inputs,
popups, modal dialogs and pointer drags retain their input.

## Key commands

| Command | Params |
|---|---|
| `file.new` | `{kind?, template?, name?, size?, width?, height?}`; material width/height override size per axis (default 1024 px), rounded down to powers of two in 16..8192; creation is one undo step. Templates from `graph.templates`: `empty`, `pbr`, `atomics` |
| `graph.node.edit` | `{}` resolves the selected FX-Map, processor or local graph instance to `{kind, node, parameter?, graph?}`; use `ui.menu.invoke` to enter it in the graph panel |
| `graph.pattern.set` | `{id, pattern}` replaces an FX-Map subgraph with cycle validation and undo |
| `graph.node.add` | `{def, at?, params?, connectFrom?: {node, port?}, label?}` |
| `graph.connect` / `graph.disconnect` | `{from, fromPort?, to, toPort?}` / `{to, toPort}` |
| `graph.wire.insertDot` | `{to, toPort, at?}`: split the wire feeding `to.toPort` with a reroute Dot node at `at` (graph point, default midway), selected |
| `graph.wire.swap` / `graph.wire.delete` | `{wires: [{to, toPort}, ...]}`: swap (two) or reverse (more, in input order) where the wires come from / delete them, one undo step each |
| `graph.node.param` | `{id?, param, value}`: numbers, `[x, y]`, `"#rrggbb"`, enum index, curve `[[x, y], …]`, gradient `[[pos, color], …]`, or a typed value `{"t": "function", "v": {...}}` |
| `graph.node.base` | `{id?, sizeMode?, size?, format?, seed?, tiling?}` |
| `graph.exposed.add` / `graph.exposed.set` | `{id, label?, default?, bind?: {node, param}}` (with `bind`, `id` may be omitted: the input is named after the parameter, `opacity`, `opacity_1`…) / `{id, value}` |
| `graph.node.function` | `{id?, param, function}` drives a parameter by a function graph of the graph's inputs (dynamic parameter); `{id?, param, remove: true}` removes it |
| `graph.preset.save` / `.apply` / `.delete` | `{name}`: store, restore or remove the current input values |
| `graph.createFromSelection` | `{name?, ids?}`: move nodes into a sub-graph and replace them with an instance |
| `view.2d` / `view.3d` | which node the 2D view shows, channel, tiling, histogram; scene, environment, camera, tiling, `heightScale` (how far the height output raises the mesh, in mesh radii) and `heightLevel` (the height that stays on the surface; 0 = the relief rises out of it), `normalYFlip` (interpret DirectX normal maps; default false/OpenGL), `transparency` (see through where the alpha is below one: the opacity output, else the base color's alpha), `alphaView` (show the alpha channel) |
| `view.3d.loadMesh` | `{path}` shows an OBJ, glTF or GLB mesh (scene `custom`) |
| `library.list` | `{filter?, category?}`: every node with ports and parameters |

## 3D material assignment

`view.3d.outputs {graph?, reset?}` applies a material graph's image outputs by their usage.
`graph` accepts an index or name and defaults to the open graph. Ordinary application preserves
unmatched channel assignments; `reset: true` clears them while preserving the scene, camera and lighting.
Outputs with unsupported usages or scalar/vector results cannot supply material textures.

`view.3d.assign {graph?, node?, port?, channel, reset?}` assigns an individual image to `baseColor`,
`normal`, `roughness`, `metallic`, `height`, `ambientOcclusion`, `emissive` or `opacity`.
The node defaults to the selection only in the open graph. The port accepts an identifier or index;
terminal Output nodes use `output` or index 0. Assignments refer to their source graph and named port,
update when that source changes, and remain active while editing a Function Graph.
`view.3d.clear {}` removes assignments without resetting the scene.

Opening a material graph automatically previews its output usages. Selecting or previewing a node
in 2D does not reassign the 3D material. Dragging a graph from Explorer onto the 3D view applies its outputs without opening the graph.
Canvas and Explorer context menus use the same assignment
commands; the 3D View's Material menu lists its channel sources. A Height-only output affects height
sampling, not Base Color; assign that image to `baseColor` to inspect its grayscale pattern on the mesh.

`session.inspect.material3d` reports assignments and resolved channels, including source graph/node/port,
image dimensions and mean values. Assignment commands leave the package and document undo history
unchanged. Document undo restores the associated source references; replacing a package clears them.

## Function graphs

`file.new {"kind": "function", "name": "Calculation"}` creates a standalone Function Graph.
Omit `kind`, or use `"material"`, for a Graph. `graph.function.set {"function": {...}}` replaces
the active standalone function through one validated, undoable command.
Both `graph.function.set` and `graph.function.edit` accept an optional `target`: `{"kind":"graph"}`
(the default), `{"kind":"parameter","node":12,"parameter":"function"}`,
`{"kind":"dynamic","node":12,"parameter":"opacity"}`, or
`{"kind":"pattern","owner":12,"node":3,"parameter":"patternrotation"}`.

`graph.function.edit` accepts `edit: {action: add|move|connect|value|output, ...}`.
For example, `{"edit":{"action":"add","operation":"mul","at":[256,0],"snap":true}}`
creates and returns a node ID using the same defaults as library and context-menu insertion.
`graph.pattern.edit` accepts the FX-Map owner `id` and
`edit: {action: add|move|connect|disconnect|root|value, ...}`.
Use `command.list` for command descriptions and the serialized `FunctionEdit`/`PatternEdit` types
in `crates/engine/src/` for the action fields. Value edits are individual undo steps by default;
`merge: true` groups repeated updates to the same target and value until `edit.finish` or another
edit ends the group. Idle UI frames preserve explicitly requested automation groups.

`ui.menu.invoke` sends selection actions to the focused editor, including embedded Function
windows. `ui.inspect.subgraph.target` identifies that Function target; its canvas rectangles and
ports correspond to the same editor. Raw `command.run` calls retain their explicit command targets.


Selection and clipboard commands (`graph.select`, `edit.selectAll`, `edit.copy`, `edit.cut`,
`edit.paste`, `edit.duplicate`, `edit.delete`, their without-link/relink variants and upstream/downstream
selection) also work without a UI. They infer the active standalone Function Graph. To address an
embedded graph, pass `function: <FunctionGraphTarget>` or `pattern: <owner node id>` and explicit
`ids` for selection-dependent operations. `edit.selectAll` returns those IDs. An optional numeric
`graph` guards against the owning graph no longer being active. `graph.align` accepts the same
Function and FX-Map targets with explicit IDs.

Results include `ids` and `selected`; copy/cut also return `copied` and a typed `clip` accepted by
paste. The session retains the most recent embedded clipboard. Cross-target paste keeps internal
links and drops external links. Standalone commands update the session selection; embedded commands
return their selection without changing the parent selection. Invalid operations preserve the
document, clipboard, selection and undo history. Creation and all function/pattern setters share
cycle, capacity, ID and position validation.


A function has `nodes` and an optional `output` node id. Each node has `id`, native `op`,
`inputs` (source ids or null for unwired ports), optional `value`, `type_code` and `pos`.
For example, `const_float1` supplies a scalar and `mul` multiplies its `a` and `b` inputs.
The catalog in `crates/nodes/src/function/catalog.rs` defines all native operation and port ids.
Processors and dynamic parameters use the same function representation. Graph validation and
execution use bounded iterative traversal and reject cycles.

`graph.annotation.select {"kind": "frame"|"comment", "id": ...}` selects an annotation.
`graph.frame.edit` accepts `title`, `titleVisible`, `description`, `color` and `rect`.
`graph.frame.move {"id": ..., "by": [dx, dy], "snapToGrid": true}` moves enclosed nodes,
comments, nested frames and pins together. `graph.comment.edit` accepts `text`, `at` and `size`.
`session.inspect` includes annotation selection and the standalone function; `ui.inspect`
includes frame and comment rectangles for synthetic input.

## Portable materials (TextureCraft)

A `.mcmat` portable material is a zip: `material.json` (manifest), `maps/<usage>.png` and
`source.sbs` (the package). TextureCraft applies it as a fill layer and keeps the exposed inputs
editable, re-cooking through `materialcraft-cli`. The format is a convention the two apps share;
each has its own reader and writer (`crates/formats/src/material.rs` here), so keep them in step.

```json
{ "format": "craft-material", "version": 2, "name": "Brick wall", "graph": "Brick_wall", "size": [2048, 2048],
  "maps": [{"usage": "baseColor", "file": "maps/baseColor.png", "colorSpace": "srgb"}],
  "parameters": [{"id": "wear", "label": "Wear", "default": {"t": "float", "v": 0.5}, "min": 0, "max": 1,
                  "value": {"t": "float", "v": 0.8}}],
  "inputs": [{"identifier": "curvature", "kind": "gray"}],
  "presets": [{"name": "Worn", "values": {"wear": {"t": "float", "v": 1.0}}}],
  "source": "source.sbs" }
```

- Usages come from the shared `ComponentUsage` catalog (the first output of each, excluding
  `any`). The catalog includes PBR, diffuse/specular, coat, sheen, scattering and user channels.
  Color maps are 8-bit sRGB PNGs; data maps are 16-bit linear. Each map records its color space.
  Additional usage identifiers do not change the manifest version; consumers may ignore usages
  they do not support. Normals are tangent space, OpenGL (Y+); height is 0..1 with 0.5 at the surface.
  The 3D preview supports base color (including `diffuse`), normal, roughness, metallic, height,
  ambient occlusion, emissive and opacity; other usages remain available for SBS and exports.
- Parameters are the exposed inputs other apps can set (float, float2-4, int, int2, bool, color,
  enum), values in the typed form `{"t", "v"}`; colors are linear RGBA.
- Inputs are the graph's input nodes. Mesh maps feed them by identifier: `ambientOcclusion`,
  `curvature`, `thickness`, `position`, `worldNormal`, `normal`, `height`, `id`, `bentNormal`,
  `opacity`, `colorMap`, `worldDirection`.
- Readers ignore unknown fields and require manifest `version` 2.

| Command | Params |
|---|---|
| `file.exportMaterial` | `{path, graph?, size? (px), values? {input: value}, inputs? {identifier: image path}}`: cook and write a `.mcmat`. TextureCraft runs `materialcraft-cli run source.sbs file.exportMaterial {...}` to re-cook at its texture set's resolution with its own values and baked mesh maps |
| `file.sendToTextureCraft` | `{graph?}`: export into TextureCraft's library folder (`Documents/TextureCraft/library`), where its shelf lists it |
| `graph.input.bind` / `graph.input.unbind` | `{identifier, resource? \| path?, linear?}` / `{identifier}`: a preview image for an input node (a mesh map exported from TextureCraft), saved in the package |
| `file.open` | opens native `.sbs` packages, and a `.mcmat`'s source package, on its graph, with no file name. Returns `warnings`: what an SBS file holds that MaterialCraft can't read yet (missing nodes are kept as placeholders); also in `session.inspect` as `package.warnings` |
| `file.save` | `{path?}`: native SBS; `.sbs` is appended when the path does not end in `.sbs` |

## MCP tools

`session_inspect`, `command_list`, `command_run`, `command_batch`, `library_list`, `graph_new`,
`node_add`, `node_connect`, `node_param`, `package_open`, `package_save`, `bitmap_import`,
`outputs_export`, `material_export`, `view_render` (headless) and, bridged to the app, `view_screenshot`,
`ui_screenshot`, `ui_inspect`, `ui_menu_invoke`, `ui_input`. `package_open` opens `.mcmat` files
too, and `material_export` `{path, graph?, size?, values?}` writes one below `--write-root` (`path` is
relative, the parent folder must exist, `values` are exposed input values). The workspace sandbox
still refuses `file.*` commands, so a sandboxed agent exports through the tool, not `file.exportMaterial`;
mesh-map `inputs` stay a CLI feature.

While an FX-Map subgraph is open, `ui.inspect.subgraph` identifies its owner and selection. Canvas
node IDs and ports refer to that embedded graph. `ui.menu.invoke` with `ui.graph.parent` returns
to the parent canvas.

Automation command requests each form a separate undo step. Embedded graph edits may explicitly
pass `merge: true` to continue one gesture; an ordinary request ends that merge. UI slider gestures
still coalesce until release. `material_export` uses the headless write-root capability and does not
expose unrestricted engine file paths.

Bitmap Color space selects sRGB or Linear. `graph.input.bind` accepts `linear: true` for normal,
height and other data maps. Input preview bindings persist in native SBS graph options with the
`materialcraft.previewImage.` and `materialcraft.previewLinear.` prefixes; these options describe
MaterialCraft editor previews and do not establish external application interoperability.
